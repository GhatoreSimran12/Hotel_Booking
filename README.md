Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Features:

Hotel Search: Users can search for hotels based on location, date, and other criteria.
Hotel Details: Each hotel listing includes comprehensive information like name, amenities, room types, and photos.
Booking Functionality: Users can seamlessly book rooms directly through the website.
User Management (Optional): Optionally, the website can allow users to create accounts for managing bookings and past history.
Benefits:

User-Friendly Interface: The React.js frontend provides a smooth and responsive user experience for searching and booking hotels.
Scalable and Secure Backend: The MERN stack offers a robust and scalable backend architecture for handling user requests and database interactions securely.
Real-time Availability: The application can potentially display real-time hotel availability for an enhanced booking experience (requires additional development).
